I am a software engineer and IT professional based out of Nashville, Tennessee. I graduated from Middle Tennessee State University in 2021, where I majored in Computer Science with a minor in Political Science.

Coding has captivated me from a young age. I first learned to code following early Flash tutorials on Newgrounds. This evolved into developing text-based adventure games, laying the foundation for my enduring passion for development. Over the years, that passion has guided me toward a path of continous learning.

I am on the lookout for a forward-thinking organization that fosters professional growth while providing opportunities to engage with impactful projects. I am driven by the belief that technology can shape a better future for individuals and communities alike.
