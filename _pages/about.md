I am a software engineer and IT professional based out of Nashville, Tennessee. I am a graduate of Middle Tennessee State University, where I majored in Computer Science with a minor in Political Science. I enjoy thinking about systems, and developing in the space where design and technology meets to create great user experiences.

My passion is building solutions. Whether developing internal tools, furthering automation efforts, or improving UX, you can be sure to find me with an extra project.

Join me as I document my development and growth journey. Here I will break down my projects, provide retrospectives as I expand my professional credentials, and share my thoughts on the state of software and all things where interactive experiences are concerned.
